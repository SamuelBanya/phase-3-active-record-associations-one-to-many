These are the commands I used for this assignment:

The relationship of the tables in this assignment is 'one to many' in that there are 'games' with many different 'reviews'.

We first created a 'games' table with the 'bundle exec rake db:create_migration NAME=create_games' command since we just needed to start out with games that we could later review:
#+begin_src bash
samuelbanya@Samuels-MBP ~/hub/Development/code/phase-3/phase-3-active-record-associations-one-to-many $ bundle exec rake db:create_migration NAME=create_games

db/migrate/20220903132121_create_games.rb
#+end_src

Within the 'db/migrate/20220903132121_create_games.rb' file, I used the following contents:
#+begin_src ruby
class CreateGames < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.1]
  def change
    create_table :games do |t|
      t.string :title
      t.string :genre
      t.string :platform
      t.integer :price
      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
#+end_src

NOTE: In order to create a 'foreign key' relationship using the Active Record conventions, you need to specify the other name of the 'id' with '(other_table_name)_id'

This is because the foreign key must match the name of the table where the primary key is located.

Ex:
We need the 'game_id' foreign key column in the 'reviews' table so that we can associate it with the primary key in the 'games' table.

I then used the 'bundle exec rake db:create_migration NAME=create_reviews' command to create the related 'create_reviews' migration accordingly:
#+begin_src bash
samuelbanya@Samuels-MBP ~/hub/Development/code/phase-3/phase-3-active-record-associations-one-to-many $ bundle exec rake db:create_migration NAME=create_reviews

db/migrate/20220903132837_create_reviews.rb
#+end_src

I then placed the following contents inside the 'db/migrate/20220903132837_create_reviews.rb' file:
#+begin_src ruby
  class CreateReviews < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.1]
    def change
      create_table :reviews do |t|
        t.integer :score
        t.string :comment
        # NOTE: This is the 'foreign key' for the 'games table:
        t.integer :game_id
        t.timestamps
      end
    end
  end
#+end_src

I then ran the related migration with the 'bundle exec rake db:migrate' command:
#+begin_src bash
samuelbanya@Samuels-MBP ~/hub/Development/code/phase-3/phase-3-active-record-associations-one-to-many $ bundle exec rake db:migrate

== 20220903132121 CreateGames: migrating ======================================

-- create_table(:reviews)
   -> 0.0006s
== 20220903132837 CreateReviews: migrated (0.0006s) ===========================
#+end_src

I then seeded the database with the 'bundle exec rake db:seed' command:
#+begin_src bash
samuelbanya@Samuels-MBP ~/hub/Development/code/phase-3/phase-3-active-record-associations-one-to-many $ bundle exec rake db:seed
ðŸŒ± Seeding data...
ðŸŒ± Done seeding!
#+end_src

I then used the 'bundle exec rake console' command so that I could explore the Active Record based macros that are available from the 'ActiveRecord::Base' class:
#+begin_src bash
samuelbanya@Samuels-MBP ~/hub/Development/code/phase-3/phase-3-active-record-associations-one-to-many $ bundle exec rake console

[1] pry(main)> review = Review.first()

#+end_src

Now that we were able to create a variable that referred to the first 'review' record found to determine it's 'game_id' to later then find the game itself in the 'games' table with the help of the 'Game' class's 'Game.find()' method, we can then modify the 'app/models/review.rb' file accordingly:
#+begin_src ruby
class Review < ActiveRecord::Base
  # NOTE: A review belongs to a game:
  def game
    # 'self' is the 'Review' class instance:
    Game.find(self.game_id)
  end
end
#+end_src

I then used 'rake console' again with these changes so that I can access the new '.game' method I just created above:
#+begin_src ruby
samuelbanya@Samuels-MBP ~/hub/Development/code/phase-3/phase-3-active-record-associations-one-to-many $ bundle exec rake console

[1] pry(main)> Review.first.game()

#+end_src

I then established the association to the 'games' table with the 'belongs_to :game' section here in the same 'app/models/review.rb' file:

#+begin_src ruby
class Review < ActiveRecord::Base
  # NOTE: We use the 'belongs_to' macro so that we can establish the foreign key relationship to the
  # 'games' table
  belongs_to :game

  # NOTE: This is the SQL statement that is being run by Active Record with the 'belongs_to' macro:
  # SELECT "games".*
  # FROM "games"
  # WHERE "games"."id" = 1
  # LIMIT 1;

  # NOTE: The following section would have been required if we did not use the 'belongs_to'
  # Active Record macro:

  # NOTE: A review belongs to a game:
  # def game
  # 'self' is the 'Review' class instance:
  # Game.find(self.game_id)
  # end
end
#+end_src

I then modified the 'app/models/game.rb' file with the following contents to include the 'has_many' macro to establish the relationship that the single game has many reviews associated with it:
#+begin_src ruby
class Game < ActiveRecord::Base
  # NOTE: This uses the 'has_many' macro to establish the relationship that the single game
  # has many reviews associated with it:
  has_many :reviews
end
#+end_src

I then tested my changes with 'bundle exec rake console':
#+begin_src ruby
samuelbanya@Samuels-MBP ~/hub/Development/code/phase-3/phase-3-active-record-associations-one-to-many $ bundle exec rake console

I then proceeded to take advantage of the 'belongs_to' macro by creating another 'Review' class instance using the 'Game' instance I created as well within the 'bundle exec rake console', but also compared it to the original vanilla method of having to use the 'foreign key' first:
